    GETTING STARTED::

        To run the Chat PDF Assistant, follow these steps:

        1. Clone the Repository:
            git clone <repository_url>
            cd django_chat

        2. Install Dependencies: 
            Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. 
            Use the requirements.txt to install the necessary packages:

            COMMAND FOR THIS::
                pip install -r requirements.txt

        3. Set Up Google Credentials: 
            Set your Google Application credentials:

            COMMAND FOR THIS::
                export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/google-credentials.json"

        4. Run the Application:
            Start the Streamlit application:

            COMMAND FOR THIS::
                streamlit run main.py

        5. Interact with the Assistant:

            You can type questions directly into the input field or use the voice assistant feature by clicking the "Ask via Voice" button.


    MODULES USED::

        1. LangChain: Used for building the conversational AI framework, including handling questions and answers.
        
        2. SpeechRecognition: Used for converting speech to text input from the user.
        
        3. PyPDF2: Used to read PDF files and extract text from them.
        
        4. Pyttsx3: A text-to-speech conversion library for Python.
        
        5. Streamlit: A web framework for creating interactive web applications quickly.
        
        6. FAISS: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, used here for storing embeddings.



    FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS::

        1. User Authentication: Implementing user authentication for personalized experiences.
        
        2. Multi-Language Support: Extending support to multiple languages for broader accessibility.
        
        3. Enhanced Error Handling: Improving error handling to provide users with more informative messages.
        
        4. Analytics Dashboard: Creating an analytics dashboard to track user queries and responses for better understanding of user needs.
        
        5. Custom Embedding Models: Integrating support for custom embedding models to enhance context understanding.



    DRAWBACKS::

        1. Dependency on Internet: The application requires internet access for Google Speech Recognition and Google Generative AI services.
        
        2. Voice Recognition Accuracy: Speech recognition may not be perfect, especially in noisy environments.
        
        3. PDF Format Limitations: Complex PDF layouts may result in inaccurate text extraction.
